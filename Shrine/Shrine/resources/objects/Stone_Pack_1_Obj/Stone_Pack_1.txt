Low poly Stones for Games.
After you place some stones, rotate them until they dont look too dark  or too bright with your scene lightning.

There is also a similar terrain texture (It looks better when not tiled too much).
 
It was originally made for old game engine Reality Factory,for making games with no programming.
RF had a big success iin its days.

If anyone is interested,a new open source Reality Factory,the RF2 is on now in develpment,but there is only one developer whith little time to spare 
on the project and progress,
So,if any programmer is interested to help developing this wonderful Game engine that will make game developing easy to anyone,
can get the code from there and start working

http://sourceforge.net/projects/realityfactory2/

visit the RF2 forum for details, Developer is User: Paradoxnj

Export all Lod levels,and the game engine will render each one according the rendering distance.
